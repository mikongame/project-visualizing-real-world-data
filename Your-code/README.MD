## Project Description

### Overview

The goal of this project was to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data, yet I decided to use the data I cleaned and transformed for the previous project.


### Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* We had to select a dataset from a public source but, despite being in a public github repo, we used the datasets resulting from the previous project.
* We created a Jupyter noteboosk to analyze the data.
* Using our data, we tried to create a at least of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph. Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis when appropriate as well as a title for the graph.
* Explain what insights can be inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.

### Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables were pushed to our Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Jupyter Notebook** containing the analysis and the code used to obtain this analysis.
* **An data folder** containing the datasets
* **A README.md** containing a detailed explanation of the followed approach visializing and analysing the information.

## Datasets
 
* The datasets we'll use are 4 csv files: pikalyticsDF_clean, cointaining the cleaned information resulting from using pikalytics API; wikidexDF_clean, that includes cleaned information obtained from wikidex web page; Combined_DF_clean, that combines the previous datasets; and outliers_clean, which states those pokemon that are very rarely used in VGC 2020. It is to be noted that we we'll focuse on the 2 latest.
* If we have time enough we will srcape information from various webpages so as to create a new dataset joining and listing the top 5 contestants' teams of masters category during the 12 years the championship has been organised.
